# Haskell Shoot 'Em Up game (title still in progress)

## Introduction
This little game was made in a functional programming course at Utrecht University.
In this game you fly a little plane and you try to avoid getting shot by enemies.
Fortunately you can shoot back and the more enemies you hit the higher your score.
If you manage to survive long enough a boss will spawn and if you beat it you complete the level.

## Running the game
'cabal build', then 'cabal run' in the terminal should run the game.

## Controls
- You move the plane with either 'wasd' or the arrow keys.
- You shoot automatically.
- Pressing 'p' will pause the game.
- You can pickup items by flying over them. (there are no items yet)

please do not resize the game or you will not know what area is out of bounds
